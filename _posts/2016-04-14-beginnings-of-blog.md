So I took the plunge, bought a domain name and put up a blog (or a template of blog) within a week, after at least half a year of planning to do so. Buying the domain name was the hardest part so far, as choosing the domain name that will probably stick around for a long time feels like such a big decision.  

The reasons I have for creating a blog/site are numerous:

* I wanted to dive in and tinker around with code
* It's a great way to showcase myself or my work to a prospective employer as it's going to double up as both a blog and a landing page site which links to ~~future~~ development projects I might engross myself in
* I'm able to pen down my thoughts, helping me process through them more carefully
* Writing down solutions for problems I've encountered means I don't need to remember them since I can always refer back to these posts if I need a refresher. It may help others who have encountered the same issues too
* There's the prospect of monetizing the site and earning a side income from it (I wish)
* Also, my writing sucks so it'll be good practice (I'm more of a technical writer) 

Currently, I have a couple of ideas of what I plan to post, but they are still just vague ideas in my mind. The blog will probably be split into a couple of different themes/topics. Part of it will be IT/coding, part of it will be life within the Singapore context, as that's the country I grew up in, and am still living in. Or I can just let it shape itself based on what I feel like posting.

With all that aside, I do hope that those who read my posts are able to benefit out of them as much as I did when writing them! :)
