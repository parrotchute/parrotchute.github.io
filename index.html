<p>I have no idea how you've stumble across this tiny part of the internet, but since you're here, make yourself comfortable!</p>

<p>If you're keen on exploring, the sidebar menu should contain everything you need to navigate around.
<br/><a href="/blog/">Here</a> is where all my blog posts are, alternatively you can browse through them using the <a href="/archives/">archives</a>, <a href="/categories/">categories</a> and/or <a href="/tags/">tags</a>.</p>

<p>Some pages are still under construction so you might see a couple of weird filler pages. I'll get to them soon!</p>
